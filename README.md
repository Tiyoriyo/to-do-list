# To-Do List Application 📋

This To-Do List application was built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It is bundled with Webpack, and code quality is maintained using ESLint. While building this project, I faced the challenge of creating numerous components manually with JavaScript. In hindsight, having experience with React, I realize that building the application with React would have been significantly easier. 🚀

## Project Overview 📄

The goal of this project was to create a simple and functional To-Do List application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. This application provides features like adding, editing, and marking tasks as complete. ✅

## Features ✨

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add tasks to your to-do list. ➕
- **Edit Tasks**: Make changes to existing tasks to keep your list up to date. ✏️
- **Mark as Complete**: Track your progress by marking tasks as complete. ✅
- **User-Friendly Design**: The application's design is inspired by an Adobe Photoshop mockup, which you can view [here](https://imgur.com/YktkSTB). I aimed to replicate the design as closely as possible in the code. 🎨

## Technology Stack 💻

- **JavaScript**: The core language for building the application's functionality. 
- **CSS**: Used for styling the user interface. 🎨
- **HTML**: The structure of the web pages. 📄
- **Webpack**: Used for bundling the application. 📦
- **ESLint**: Ensures code quality and consistency. 🧹

## Project Structure 🏗️

The project follows a module pattern, organizing the code into separate folders for better maintainability and cleanliness. 📂

## Third-Party NPM Packages 📦

For this project, I utilized third-party NPM packages to expedite development and fill in the gaps where needed. This allowed me to focus on the core functionality of the application. ⚙️
These third party packages include 
- **popupS by chieforz**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/popups
- **pretty-checkbox by lokesh**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty-checkbox

## Challenges 🤔

One of the significant challenges in this project was manually creating numerous components with JavaScript. Having experience with React, I can appreciate how using React could have made the development process much smoother. 🛠️
